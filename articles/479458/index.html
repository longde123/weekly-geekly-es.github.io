They have done this many times, and only now I have had controversial feelings. <a name="habracut"></a>  In the rack there are Lan ports, there is analog telephony.  There are no bindings on the switch ports, but the telephone panel has a binding to a number and the administrator sometimes switches subscribers to save the number when moving to another office.  Before repacking, it was convenient to perform port switching work.  Patch cords were easily disconnected and it was possible to ring the port of the subscriber panel and the port of the switch or telephone panel.  After re-laying, when all the patch cords were laid in cable organizers, it became much more complicated.  With telephony, the situation is such that it is easier to disable the patch cord and leave it in the rack, connecting a new one, than to remove and reconnect.  To disconnect the old patch cords and record the port-port connection, for this you need to ring the patch cord in the rack, we spent a couple of hours, after re-laying in the rack, I understand that this procedure will take twice as much time. <br><br>  And so I thought about how to combine ease of maintenance and visual "beauty." <br><br><h3>  How to make a server rack practical </h3><br>  Of the solutions that I know, but unfortunately, have not used at this facility, these are the <b>side organizers for the cable</b> .  I am sure that if there were lateral organizers, the work on the ‚Äúringing‚Äù of the patch cord would become easier.  The stand allows you to fix them even on the side, although we usually install them on the front.  With a call, you could open the cover of the organizer and trace the route of the cable in the side organizer.  Appearance would become a little worse, but practicality would increase significantly. <br><br>  Another solution is <b>markers for patch cords</b> .  We did not do this before, perhaps we did not see the reasons for using marking, but in the next works we will try to introduce it.  I felt the ease of use when I needed to find out the connection port in a large wiring closet, and a large number of patch cords made this task difficult, since there were markers on the cable from both ends, which made it possible to ‚Äúring‚Äù the patch cord. <br>  And the last solution is a <b>cable log</b> with switching ports.  There is a room layout with the location of outlets at the facility, but there is no magazine with ports for connecting to the equipment, and we unfortunately did not do this. <br><br>  <b>I wonder what other solutions are there to create the practicality and acceptable appearance of server cabinets?</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d67/72b/03b/d6772b03b27e8d4eb67f7484f0472cc9.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/faf/838/9f8/faf8389f8ce3fe2f02a92a5e23804708.jpg" alt="image"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/479458/">https://habr.com/ru/post/479458/</a></p>
