In November 2019, Apple updated them, or rather made a fork by releasing AirPods Pro plugs.  And I, of course, tested them - I go with them from the start of sales in Russia.  In short, the difference of 7.5 thousand ‚ÇΩ between the basic version and the ‚Äúfirmware‚Äù is worth it: noise canceling is fire, the operating time is not worse, and the sound is better. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What is the difference in specs? </h4><br>  I will answer with a sign. <br><div class="scrollable-table"><table><tbody><tr><th align="left"></th><th align="center">  AirPods 2 </th><th align="center">  AirPods Pro </th></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0k/gf/j4/0kgfj4sszw-y89sv8uyaf4nwehg.jpeg"></td><td align="center"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ss/1w/aw/ss1wawsurov8ry_iwdtnram4tlk.jpeg"></td></tr><tr><td>  Color </td><td colspan="2" align="center">  white </td></tr><tr><td>  Wired interface </td><td colspan="2" align="center">  Lightning </td></tr><tr><td>  Quick connect </td><td colspan="2" align="center">  iOS and iPad OS only </td></tr><tr><td>  Total operating time </td><td align="left">  ~ 30 hours </td><td align="left">  ~ 28 hours </td></tr><tr><td>  From one charge </td><td align="left">  ~ 5.5 hours </td><td align="left">  ~ 5 hours </td></tr><tr><td>  Charging from the case </td><td align="left">  4,5 </td><td align="left">  4,5 </td></tr><tr><td>  Quick charge </td><td align="left">  10 minutes.  ‚Üí ~ 1 hours of work </td><td align="left">  5 minutes.  ‚Üí ~ 1.5 hours of work </td></tr><tr><td>  Wireless Charging Case </td><td align="left">  optionally (+ 3,5 thousand ‚ÇΩ) </td><td align="left">  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Cable included </td><td align="left">  USB Type-A ‚Üí Lightning </td><td align="left">  USB Type-C ‚Üí Lightning </td></tr><tr><td>  Touch control </td><td align="left">  touch </td><td align="left">  touch + hold </td></tr><tr><td>  Bluetooth </td><td align="left">  4.x </td><td align="left">  5.0 </td></tr><tr><td>  Noise suppression </td><td align="left">  not </td><td align="left">  active </td></tr><tr><td>  Water protection </td><td align="left">  not </td><td align="left">  IPx4 (rain but not shower) </td></tr><tr><td>  Headphone weight (in grams) </td><td align="left">  4 </td><td align="left">  5,4 </td></tr><tr><td>  Case weight (in grams) </td><td align="left">  38 </td><td align="left">  45.6 </td></tr><tr><td>  Official Price (‚ÇΩ) </td><td align="left">  <a href="https://www.apple.com/ru/shop/product/MV7N2/%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D1%2588%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8-airpods-%25D0%25B2-%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%258F%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC-%25D1%2584%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5">13,490</a> <font color="grey"><sup>with plain case</sup></font> <br>  <a href="https://www.apple.com/ru/shop/product/MRXJ2/%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D1%2588%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8-airpods-%25D0%25B2-%25D1%2584%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2581-%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C%25D1%258E-%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9-%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%258F%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8">16,990</a> <font color="grey"><sup>with a wireless case</sup></font> </td><td align="left">  <a href="https://www.apple.com/ru/shop/product/MWP22RU/A/%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D1%2588%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8-airpods-pro">20,990</a> </td></tr></tbody></table></div><br><h4>  Most importantly: what about noise reduction? </h4><br>  Very cool even against the background of any headphones with active noise reduction: - plugs with a snug fit or overhead.  Compared to standard AirPods, these are generally space.  You hold down the button, the speakers say ‚Äúdust!‚Äù And you find yourself in a vacuum. <br><br>  At AirPods Pro noise reduction is arranged differently than most competitors.  At first, everything is as usual: the microphone picks up noise from the outside, and it is compensated by a backward sound wave.  But then another microphone directed inward of the ear makes fine tuning, and the rest of the noise is suppressed again. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/te/7m/on/te7monkcxduixyxy6cxoqa-5geo.gif"><br><br>  An example from life.  On regular AirPods, listening to podcasts on the subway is not possible.  In the "firmware" - completely, and even the volume does not need to be twisted.  The noise of the street is not heard at all, in the Pro store the background music is almost completely cut off, and in the transport, the rumble is distinguishable, but very quiet. <br><br>  Passive noise reduction, perhaps, at the level of any other "plugs".  Only I do not see any reason not to include active, because  it does not noticeably affect the operating time.  Although in the settings this feature can be completely cut down, you can nevertheless: so that no noise reduction or transparency mode work. <br><br>  A nice bonus is the valve, which relieves excess air pressure between the membrane and the earpiece.  Usually my ears "itch" from this, but in these I have not noticed yet. <br><br><h4>  And what is this transparent mode? </h4><br>  This feature was made as opposed to noise reduction - in this mode, the sounds outside reach the eardrums not through the silicone inserts, but through the microphone and speaker of the headphones.  At the same time, the upper and middle frequencies are even slightly amplified.  It turns out that the headphones can not be removed.  But if music is turned on, it still clogs all the sounds from the outside - you won‚Äôt be able to pause it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7l/ei/hz/7leihzoernxjjyjp8g5tqqwn7rk.jpeg"><br><br>  And, by the way, in the "firmware" you hear your voice not as if from under the water, but as if there were no headphones.  They say that Apple worked on this specially, tuning microphones. <br><br><h4>  Sound cooler than in regular AirPods? </h4><br>  Generally speaking, yes.  In my opinion, the Pro is cooler, but the difference with conventional AirPods is not that big.  The main difference is the presence of silicone inserts and "closeness".  The nature of the sound changes due to this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wp/cf/q3/wpcfq370-finvxovphmnmwqzyzo.jpeg"><br><br>  Still, it seems that the low frequencies have been twisted very little, but otherwise they have the same smooth sound as before.  That is, these are headphones ‚Äúfor any kind of music‚Äù - they will play all equally well.  And behind the "ears" specifically for drama or for classical music - this is to other producers. <br><br><h4>  How does the automatic equalizer behave? </h4><br>  At the presentation, it was stated that the sound in this model is adjusted 200 times per second - depending on the environment.  Unless you specifically listen, you don‚Äôt notice the difference at all.  But, according to my observations, AirPods Pro, with the noise canceled on and loud sounds around, protrudes the middle frequencies a little - so that you can hear better.  Noticeable not only on music, but also on podcasts, for example.  Actually, it is not surprising - we better perceive just the frequencies of 800-3000 Hz, and human speech is in the same range. <br><br><h4>  Are they falling out or not? </h4><br>  Here, as with ordinary ones, <i>you</i> should <i>definitely</i> try.  Some people fall out, but some do not.  But the proportion of those who do not hold AirPods Pro in their ears, of course, has decreased.  Three pairs of silicone ear pads of different sizes are included: M is already worn on the headphones, and S and L are intricately packaged, as Apple can do. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dd/fo/ek/ddfoeko1ean7c4p6s-aorfye578.jpeg" width="49%"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fo/oa/gv/fooagvw0re31yucy0jomx0reycy.jpeg" width="49%"><br><br>  It is also interesting how the fitting will take place in the offline stores of the Apple Store.  After each fitting, standard AirPods are treated with a sanitizer, at least in the UK.  A silicone nozzle, in theory, it is easier to replace the whole, but is it so far, it is not clear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j6/1c/l7/j61cl7iuofys7vogkub_b8amcn8.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition to purely subjective sensations, the fit can be checked programmatically.  To do this, in the Bluetooth settings you need to click on AirPods Pro and select the corresponding item there and click on the Play button - the music will play for a few seconds, after which the headphones will issue a nozzle verdict.  M approached me the first time, and two months later, no matter what size of the ear cushions I chose the ‚Äúperfect fit‚Äù, it was not possible to achieve.  Although subjectively for two months, nothing has changed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bu/1j/-u/bu1j-u1t89ejzoxrnxaxpmryozg.jpeg"><br>  <sub><font color="grey"><i>Perfect option</i></font></sub> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8-/uv/os/8-uvoscjxem47ww3bt2pwj-jjnu.png"><br>  <sub><font color="grey"><i>Weekly option</i></font></sub> <br><br>  The ear cushion mount is unusual - much wider than the standard.  And they do not gently grip the base of the headphones, but noticeably snap into a denser, almost solid base in the grooves.  At first, the mount seems flimsy, but if you pull on the nozzle, on the contrary it becomes scary to tear it off with meat - it sits so tight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qi/ia/ei/qiiaei4utqdriwljeu1k_jlkxvc.jpeg" width="49%"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ud/ua/hs/uduahso0fezxbvtzfw8_yytz34e.jpeg" width="49%"><br><br><h4>  Is the new management convenient? </h4><br>  Previously, you could just touch the outside of the headphone and switch the track or pause.  Now the control was moved to the legs.  At the same time, the legs became shorter, and the vibration sensors were replaced by pressure sensors.  It is necessary not strongly, but precisely to squeeze the ends of the "flashing" so that they understand what you want from them.  The first two or three days were uncomfortable, and I missed, and then I learned to grab the leg the first time, and it became quite ok - no worse than before. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zd/z2/m0/zdz2m0wd9_-ph8wg82kbhhd1ko4.jpeg"><br>  <sub><font color="grey"><i>This flat area needs to be pressed</i></font></sub> <br><br><ul><li>  You squeeze it briefly once - put the track on pause or vice versa start it. </li><li>  Two times - the next song. </li><li>  Three times - the previous one. </li><li>  Long press - toggles between transparent mode and noise reduction.  If necessary, in the settings you can add a third state, when both are disabled.  Then the modes will switch cyclically. </li></ul><br>  All this, of course, can be controlled from the phone.  Switch tracks - as usual, and transparency and noise reduction are hidden in the volume slider.  By a long press on it, three corresponding buttons appear. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a4r0us76YkY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Does the case still fit in your watch pocket? </h4><br>  Yeah.  But there is a nuance: now he is only able to pull in across it, and when along it hangs there more freely than we would like.  Be careful, my case fell out a couple of times at home on the floor when I put jeans on the shelf. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xj/mi/0r/xjmi0rmjob_jx58weaw_ftg7ef8.jpeg"><br>  <sub><font color="grey"><i>AirPods Pro case: crosswise on the left, along the right</i></font></sub> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j3/_f/w0/j3_fw007f079tfpy0e5scd2smim.jpeg"><br>  <sub><font color="grey"><i>On the left is a case from conventional AirPods, on the right is from Pro</i></font></sub> <br><br><h4>  Are microphones better? </h4><br>  I will answer by recording the same passage on AirPods, AirPods Pro and iPhone 11 Pro - decide for yourself.  I think a little better. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PJ2e_C-NUSQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  What is included? </h4><br>  The Spartan package, as before: a cable for charging and two pairs of additional ear pads.  It is curious that the connector is exactly of the Type-C ‚Üí Lightning type, but there is no charger. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0d/dr/uq/0ddruqqbxfs7alm_rknuta2mune.jpeg"><br><br>  That is, it is assumed that you either have a Qi platform for wireless charging, or have the latest iPhone with the necessary adapter in the kit, or one of the latest MacBooks.  Another option is to take a standard USB cable ‚Üí Lightning. <br><br><h4>  How much does a network adapter cost for a Type-C ‚Üí Lightning cable? </h4><br><ul><li>  In the official Apple store, branded chargers with the ‚Äúmom‚Äù Type-C, as for the latest iPhones, are not sold.  But there are such, for example, in Citylink for 2620 ‚ÇΩ. </li><li>  At Ya Market, there is something Chinese called Baseus Bojure Series Type-C Baseus Bojure Series Type-C, for $ 775. </li><li>  If you want to use wireless charging, then Xiaomi sells such from 875 ‚ÇΩ. </li><li>  The last option is the classic USB Type-A ‚Üí Lightning cable.  Most likely you will find it somewhere in the bins.  And if not, then the branded one costs 1820 ‚ÇΩ.  On the Internet it can be found for at least 890 ‚ÇΩ, and the analogue - generally from 30 ‚ÇΩ. </li></ul><br><h4>  What about autonomy? </h4><br>  Headphones work for a total of more than a day - as before.  But still, the operating time has decreased a bit, probably due to active noise reduction.  I could stand the classic AirPods for 30 hours, and these could only last 28. At the same time, the battery life decreased by about half an hour, although subjectively this is not noticeable.  Plus, Apple has worked on fast charging and now the headphones last five minutes in a case to work for an hour and a half. <br><br>  In general, if you do not go with a stopwatch, it turns out that you need to charge the case about once a week. <br><br><h4>  Do they work with Android? </h4><br>  Yes, of course, like any other BT headphones.  And even the noise cutter will work - it will be cut and cut by a long press on the sensors. <br><br>  True, with an Android phone, AirPods will not be able to create a pair simply by opening the cover of the case.  First you have to put the headphones into detection mode: hold down the button on the back of the case until the white LED starts flashing in front.  After that, they will be visible in the Bluetooth menu on the smartphone. <br><br>  In addition, on gadgets running Android there is no software like on the iPhone, which allows you to reassign the buttons on the headphones.  That is, a long press on any earphone will always turn noise reduction on or off, and Siri, of course, cannot be called up - from nowhere. <br><br><h4>  What other TWS headphones with active noise canceling? </h4><br>  Of the commercially available - <b>Sony WF-1000XM3</b> .  They cost about 18 000 ‚ÇΩ, and before the New Year and still are at a discount for 14 500 ‚ÇΩ.  They are more compact, but with autonomy they have worse.  The case is visually almost the same as the AirPods Pro, but it comes in different colors.  Like the headphones.  Noise reduction - on top. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xo/lu/_w/xolu_wjsmvtht9djd3_1tgonvre.jpeg" width="100%"><br><br>  Audio-Technica at the beginning of 2020, at CES, showed its vision of such "ears" - the <b>QuietPoint ANC300TW</b> model.  Of the distinguishing features - IPX2 waterproof, and specific noise reduction profiles: in an airplane, on the street, in an office, etc.  Theoretically, a more specialized algorithm will do a better job than a universal algorithm, but this is obviously less convenient.  Headphones will cost $ 230 (slightly less than AirPods Pro), but it is not yet known whether they will be sold in Russia. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zx/cn/nt/zxcnntp8k4izoghduemrmzuoq8i.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  What did not like in the "firmware"? </h4><br><ul><li>  The lid of the case opens easier than on classic AirPods.  And the headphones are not so densely ‚Äúsucked‚Äù by magnets into the sockets.  Sometimes you will drop the case, and then the ‚Äúears‚Äù will fly to the floor in different directions.  With ordinary Airpods this happened less often. </li><li>  Sometimes the left earphone behaves strangely when you take it out of the case.  It seems to be 100% charged, but does not cling to the phone.  This happens about once in 10 attempts.  You have to put it back in the case, get it out - and then after a second it is already picked up.  Perhaps the matter is specifically in my copy, because from other owners of the "firmware" I have not heard this. </li><li>  There is no version in black, but I would really like to. </li></ul><br><h4>  What did you like? </h4><br>  Just about everything else: bass, noise reduction, battery life, compact case, wireless charging, native work with iPhones and other Apple ecosystems. </div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/479356/">https://habr.com/ru/post/479356/</a></p>
